Buying a replica watch online can be safe and rewarding if you follow the right steps. This guide walks you through the process from research to delivery, so you can avoid scams and get the best value for your money.

## Research: Where to Start

- **Browse Forums:** Communities like Reddit’s r/RepTime and RepGeek offer advice and dealer reviews.
- **Read Guides:** Start with [our glossary](/guide/basics/replica-watch-glossary) and [quality tiers](/guide/basics/replica-watch-quality-tiers).
- **Identify Models:** Decide which watch (brand/model) you want and research its best factories.

## Choosing a Trusted Dealer

- **Use Trusted Dealer Lists:** Only buy from dealers recommended by major forums, see our [Trusted Dealer List](/dealers).
- **Check Dealer Communication:** A good dealer responds promptly and provides clear answers.
- **Ask for References:** Look for customer feedback and photo reviews.

## Placing Your Order

2. **Request Photos:** Ask for current, in-stock photos of the actual watch.
3. **Confirm Price & Shipping:** Get a clear quote including shipping and payment fees.

Most dealers will reship once for free, but always check their policy before buying.
