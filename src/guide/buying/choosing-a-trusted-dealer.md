# How to Choose a Trusted Dealer

Finding a reputable dealer is the most important step in buying a replica watch. Here’s how to spot the good ones and avoid the bad.

## Red Flags to Avoid

- **No Reviews:** Avoid dealers with no presence on major forums.
- **Stock Photos Only:** Insist on real, in-hand photos.
- **Pushy Sales:** Beware of dealers who pressure you to buy quickly.
- **Unusual Payment Requests:** Never send money via Western Union or gift cards.

## Where to Find Dealer Reviews

- **RepTime and RepGeek:** Community-vetted dealer lists.
- **Review Threads:** Look for “TD” (Trusted Dealer) feedback threads.
- **Photo Reviews:** Real customer photos are the best proof.

## Contacting Dealers: What to Ask

- Is the watch in stock?
- Can you provide current QC photos?
- What is your return or reship policy?
- What payment methods do you accept?
