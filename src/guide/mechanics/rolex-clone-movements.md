Use this page as a quick, readable reference when comparing Rolex-based replica movements and their trade-offs. Last summarized: 2025-09-05

## Quick Summary

- Modern Rolex reps mostly use Chinese “clone” movements that mimic Rolex calibers.
- Clones vary in faithfulness, reliability, parts compatibility, and serviceability.
- For daily wear: prioritize known-reliable families (e.g., VR/VS for 31xx/32xx) and choose watchsmiths familiar with these clones.

## Key Terms

- Caliber family: Rolex reference of the genuine movement (e.g., 3135, 3235, 3186/3285, 4130).
- Clone name: Factory designation of the movement that imitates the genuine caliber (e.g., VR3135, VS3235, SH3135).
- Drop-in compatibility: Whether gen parts can replace clone parts without heavy modification.

## Movement Families Overview

Below are the most common Rolex clone families grouped by genuine caliber. Each clone gets its own row and is ordered by dogwood’s overall sentiment (best first within each caliber). Power reserve and interchangeability are approximate and vary by batch and servicing.

### 3135 (Datejust/Sub/GMT variants pre-32xx)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VR3135 | 28,800 bph | 38–48h | Preferred among 3135 clones | Mature platform, decent parts support | Batch variance; calendar/auto-wind quirks | Partial (some gen parts fit) |
| SH3135 | 28,800 bph | 38–48h | Usable, but behind VR | Widely available, many builds | QC variability, requires careful service | Partial/limited |

### 3235 (modern DJ/Sub, no GMT)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VS3235 | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Often the safer pick | Longer PR; good winding feel | Amplitude variance reported; date-jump tuning | Low–partial |
| VR3235 | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Solid alternative | Close visual parity | Fewer long-term reports; parts sourcing | Low–partial |

### 3186 (older GMT architecture)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VR3186 | 28,800 bph | ~48h | Acceptable for 3186 builds | Functional GMT; stable in recent batches | GMT gear train sensitivity; hand stack nuances | Partial at best |

### 3285 (modern GMT)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DD3285 (Dandong) | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Top recommendation for GMT | Most robust 3285 clone; strong owner feedback | Newer platform, parts channel maturing | Low |
| VR3285 | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Secondary choice | Mirrors 32xx architecture | Fewer reports; parts scarce | Low |
| VS3285 | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Also seen, mixed | Similar spec on paper | Limited data; batch variability | Low |

### 4131 (modern Daytona)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DD4131 (Dandong) | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Best choice for 4131 builds | Strong chrono architecture; promising reliability | Complex to service; needs qualified watchmaker | Low |
| Other 4130/4131-style clones | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Varies widely | Availability | Mixed QC; chrono train sensitivity | Low/variable |

### 4130 (previous-gen Daytona)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Notable 4130 clones (legacy) | 28,800 bph | 60–70h | Service-dependent | True chrono architecture | Requires expert service; aging stock | Low/variable |

### 2235/2236 (ladies/31mm)

| Clone (Factory) | Typical Beat | Claimed PR | Dogwood Sentiment | Strengths | Weaknesses | Interchangeability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Asian 2235/2236 “style” | 28,800 bph | ~40–55h | Limited data | Size-correct options exist | Sparse documentation; parts limited | Low |

Notes:
- Claimed PR often differs from real-world results—verify with a full wind and timegrapher.
- Factories iterate: the same label (VR/VS/DD) may hide batch changes; judge by current reports and watchsmith feedback.

## Recommendations by Use Case

- Daily wear, minimal fuss: pick a model using VR/VS clones with many owner reports (e.g., VR3135, VS3235). Ask your dealer to confirm factory and batch.
- Chronograph-first buyers (Daytona): work with a watchsmith who specifically services 4130-style clones; avoid frequent start/stop if unserviced.
- GMT buyers: ensure correct hand stack for your build; test GMT setting for positive engagement and backlash.

## What to Check on Arrival (QC/Initial Service)

- Timegrapher: amplitude (>260° typically good), rate (aim near 0 s/d), beat error (<0.6 ms if possible).
- Date change: quickset engages cleanly; midnight change occurs crisply near 12.
- Winding: smooth crown feel; rotor doesn’t grind; no one-way sticking.
- Power reserve: fully wind manually and time actual run-down; compare to claimed PR.
- Hands and calendar alignment: chrono hands zero precisely (4130), date centered in window.

## Known Issue Patterns (Watchmaker Notes)

- Auto-wind gear train wear: noisy or poor reverse wheel action; service with correct oils and inspect pawls.
- Calendar jumper/tension: date wheels that “hover” between numerals—requires adjustment.
- Setting mechanisms: stem/canon pinion tolerances vary; careful lubrication during service.
- Chronograph (4130-style): operate only after full engagement; reset to zero with moderate force; don’t cycle endlessly without service.

## Serviceability and Parts

- Many clone parts are “close but not same.” Mixing gen and clone can work in limited cases but expect fitting.
- Source parts from trusted dealers familiar with movement batches; keep notes of your movement engraving and purchase date.
- If you plan long-term ownership, budget a full service within 12–24 months, earlier for chronographs.

## Visual Cues vs. Genuine (High Level)

- Balance assembly and regulator: clone balances may use different cutouts/screws or beat adjusters; loupe reveals differences.
- Bridges and engravings: fonts and depth vary; some factories have convincing nickel plating and côtes, others do not.
- Shock protection and jewels: Kif/Paraflex lookalikes exist but aren’t exact on close inspection.

## Which Factory Names Matter Most?

- VR/VS have the most consistent owner feedback for 31xx/32xx families.
- SH appears on 3135-style clones; quality ranges by batch.
- For Daytona, the “4130 clone” provenance matters less than proof of recent service and proper function.

## Practical Buyer Checklist

- Confirm the exact movement model (e.g., VS3235) in your order.
- Ask for a timegrapher photo and a 24–48h PR test result.
- For GMT/Daytona: request a short video demonstrating function set/reset.
- Plan a service if you intend to wear daily.
