# How to Set Up Your Manual Watch

Manual watches require a bit more attention than automatics or quartz, but setup is easy once you know the basics.

## Winding and Setting the Time

1. **Unscrew the Crown:** If your watch has a screw-down crown, gently unscrew it counterclockwise until it pops out.
2. **Wind the Watch:** Turn the crown clockwise (usually 20–30 turns) until you feel resistance. Don’t overwind.
3. **Set the Time:** Pull the crown out to the time-setting position. Turn to set the hour and minute hands.
4. **Push the Crown Back:** Press (and screw down if needed) to return the crown to its normal position.

## Do’s and Don’ts

- **Do:** Wind your watch at the same time each day for consistency.
- **Don’t:** Set the date between 8pm and 4am (can damage the movement).
- **Do:** Store the watch face up when not in use.
