# Understanding Automatic vs. Quartz Movements

Choosing between automatic and quartz is one of the first decisions for any replica watch buyer. Here’s what you need to know.

## How Each Movement Works

- **Automatic:** Uses a rotor that winds the mainspring as you move your wrist. No battery required.
- **Quartz:** Powered by a battery and regulated by a quartz crystal for high accuracy.

## Pros and Cons

| Feature         | Automatic            | Quartz                |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Accuracy        | Good (±10 s/day)    | Excellent (±1 s/day)  |
| Maintenance     | Needs servicing      | Battery change only   |
| Sweep Hand      | Smooth motion        | Ticks once per second |
| Power Reserve   | 36–80 hours          | Years (battery)       |
| Cost            | Higher               | Lower                 |

## Table: Movement Feature Comparison

| Feature            | Automatic | Quartz  |
|--------------------|-----------|---------|
| Accuracy           | Good      | Excellent |
| Maintenance        | Medium    | Low     |
| Power Reserve      | 1–3 days  | 1–5 years |
| Second Hand Motion | Smooth    | Ticking |

## Which is Right for You?

- **Choose Automatic** if you appreciate traditional watchmaking, want a “sweep” second hand, and don’t mind occasional winding or servicing.
- **Choose Quartz** for low maintenance, high accuracy, and a worry-free daily watch.

### FAQ

**1. Which lasts longer, automatic or quartz?**  
Quartz watches can run for years on a battery, but automatics can last a lifetime with proper care.

**2. Is quartz considered 'lesser'?**  
Not at all—many luxury brands make quartz models. It’s a matter of preference.
