# Common Replica Watch Flaws and How to Spot Them

Even the best replica watches can have flaws. Knowing what to look for helps you avoid disappointment and spot a great rep.

## Dial & Hands

- **Misaligned markers:** Hour markers that aren’t perfectly straight or evenly spaced.
- **Incorrect fonts:** Text on the dial may use the wrong font or spacing.
- **Poor lume:** Weak or uneven glow in the dark.

## Case & Engravings

- **Shallow engravings:** Genuine watches have deep, crisp engravings; reps may be shallow or uneven.
- **Incorrect caseback:** Wrong design, missing serial numbers, or rough finishing.

## Movement Issues

- **Noisy rotor:** Some reps have loud or gritty automatic rotors.
- **Wrong movement:** The movement may look similar but function differently.

### FAQ

**1. Can flaws be fixed after purchase?**  
Some minor issues (like lume or strap changes) can be fixed by a watchmaker, but case, dial, and movement flaws usually cannot.

**2. Are some flaws acceptable?**  
Most reps have tiny tells. Decide what you can live with—major flaws should be avoided, but minor ones may be invisible on the wrist.
