# How to Quality Check (QC) a Replica Watch

Quality Control (QC) is your last chance to catch mistakes or flaws before your watch ships. Here’s how to do it right.

## What is QC and Why is it Important?

QC means carefully reviewing photos of your actual watch before shipment. This lets you spot problems and avoid disappointment.

## Step-by-Step QC Process

1. **Receive QC Photos:** Dealer sends multiple angles (front, back, side, clasp).
2. **Check Alignment:** Are the hour markers, hands, and logo straight?
3. **Inspect Dial:** Look for dust, smudges, or printing errors.
4. **Case & Engravings:** Are they sharp and accurate?
5. **Movement:** If visible, check for correct rotor and engravings.

## Table: QC Checklist

| Item         | What to Look For           |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Dial         | Clean, no dust or marks   |
| Hands        | Aligned, no scratches     |
| Date Wheel   | Centered, correct font    |
| Caseback     | Engravings sharp          |
| Lume         | Even, glows properly      |

## Common QC Issues

- Misaligned markers or hands
- Scratches or dents

### FAQ

**1. What if I spot a problem in QC photos?**  
Tell your dealer right away. Most will allow a replacement or fix before shipping.

**2. Can I reject a watch after QC?**  
If you “green light” (approve) the QC, most dealers consider the sale final. Only approve if you’re satisfied.
