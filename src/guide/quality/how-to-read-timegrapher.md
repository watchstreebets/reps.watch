# How to Read a Timegrapher

A timegrapher is a tool that measures the accuracy and health of a mechanical watch movement. Here’s how beginners can use one to check their replica.

## What is a Timegrapher?

A timegrapher listens to the “tick” of your watch and displays key metrics:
- **Rate:** How many seconds per day your watch gains or loses.
- **Amplitude:** The strength of the balance wheel’s swing (higher is better).
- **Beat Error:** The difference in timing between the tick and the tock (lower is better).

## Key Metrics: Beat Error, Amplitude, Rate

| Metric      | Good Value          | What it Means                   |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Rate        | -10 to +10 s/day   | Closer to zero is better        |
| Amplitude   | 250–320 degrees    | Higher = healthy movement       |
| Beat Error  | <0.6 ms            | Lower = better                  |

## Table: Example Timegrapher Readings

| Reading           | Result        | Interpretation         |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| +8 s/day          | Good         | Slightly fast         |
| 280° amplitude    | Good         | Strong movement       |
| 0.3 ms beat error | Excellent    | Well adjusted         |

## How to Use a Timegrapher

1. Place your watch on the microphone.
2. Select the correct lift angle (usually 52° for most movements).
3. Wait for the readings to stabilize (about 30 seconds).
4. Record the rate, amplitude, and beat error.

## Interpreting Results

- If your watch is gaining/losing more than 15 seconds per day, consider regulation.
- Low amplitude or high beat error may indicate a need for service.

### FAQ

**1. Is a timegrapher necessary for all reps?**  
No, but it’s useful if you want to check accuracy or troubleshoot issues.

**2. What readings are acceptable?**  
Aim for rate within ±10 s/day, amplitude above 250°, and beat error below 0.6 ms.
